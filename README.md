## This project is a single page web application for uploading schematics, images, and information about tube guitar amplifiers to create a knowledgebase for guitar circuit discovery. You will be able to view the library of amplifiers once you have signed in with a valid Google account.

## There are three layouts for the UI which depend on the screen width. The component for creating a new amp card is placed into a drawer on the left in the two mobile views and the drawer can be opened by selecting the enter a new amp button. The layout is served as a client-side rendered React application and the database is Firebase's real time database.
